Waiting:2. count_words("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") should return 9.
Waiting:3. count_words("I like coding challenges!") should return 4.
Waiting:4. count_words("Complete the challenge in JavaScript and Python.") should return 7.
Waiting:5. count_words("The missing semi-colon crashed the entire internet.") should return 7.
